script that prints hello world
a script that displays a confused smiley
Display the content of the file
what about 2
display the last 10 lines
display the first ones actually
a script that displays the third line only
it is a good file that cuts iron without making a noise
Save current state of directory
a script that duplicates the last line of the file
a script that deletes files
Don't just count your directories, make your directories count
being unique is better than bein perfect
Display lines containing the pattern root from the file 
display the number of lines
